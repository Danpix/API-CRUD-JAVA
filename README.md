*Built-in error handling for invalid requests and missing entities.

*Data persistence using JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate as the ORM.

*MySQL (or other databases) integration via Spring Data JPA.

Technologies Used

*Spring Boot - Framework for building Java-based applications.

*Spring Data JPA - For interacting with the database.

*Hibernate - ORM framework for managing entity persistence.

*MySQL - Database for storing application data (configurable for other databases).

*Maven - For dependency management.

*Spring Boot DevTools - For automatic application reload in development mode.
*Postman/cURL - For testing the API endpoints.
